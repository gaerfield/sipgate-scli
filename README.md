# sipgate-scli

Sipgate Simple Command Line Interface with only one task: Initiate a new Call (Click2Call) as command-line-tool.
The implemented extra API-calls are but not accessible through the CLI and meant only for development and testing-purposes.

current-state: broken (the xmlrpc-api of sipgate returns "Invalid Parameter" when trying to initiate a new call)
